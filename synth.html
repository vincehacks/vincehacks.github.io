            <p class="lead">Synth is a Mobile Music App that has been redesigned for the raging music junky that lives inside all of us. Our app can be thought of as a music app on steroids. My team has strategically conducted several case studies that evaluated the daily music user's likes and dislikes on today's famous music platforms such as Spotify, Pandora, Soundcloud, and Google Play. After analyzing and weighing each pro and con, my team is proud to announce the birth of Synth. Check it out on InVision: <a href="https://invis.io/QG6H5U5HJ">Synth</a><p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Hardest Decisions</h2>
            <p class="lead">Our team also used different user scenarios to help us during the design phase. In doing so, we ran into a few difficult decisions.</p>
            <h3> Scenario 1: Creating a playlist for a trip to Disneyland</h3>
            <p class="lead"> 
            <em>Decision: Whether to keep Moods &amp; Genres on the home page, or on the menu bar.</em></br> It was difficult to keep this on either page because they are both good places to have Moods &amp; Genres in. Typically, users will use the search button to find an artist rather than attempt to do a more broad search such as from Moods &amp; Genres. What we decided is to not limit the user to have only one place to look for this particular category so we just kept it in both places...best of both worlds. This is better because users will generally hang out in either the homepage when they first start the app, or in the menu page when they want to perform a specfic function.</p>
            <p class="lead">
            <em>Decision: How to improve the process of adding/removing songs from playlists.</em></br> This was probably our hardest decision. We had many great ideas we could choose from but the overwhelming winner out of all of them was to have a drag and drop method to edit playlists. We figured that all the apps had the same boring playlist management features in common and this was our way to distinguish our app from all the other ones out there. Unless there’s a particularly game changing event to jazz up the mobile app music scene, this would be the next best thing to do. Our drag and drop feature eliminates the need to have the user perform extra clicks, and to have a more natural “add to cart” feel to managing and creating playlists. With the drag and drop feature you can drag a song from the designated dragging area, then a “Quick Options” menu wheel appears from the right side. As you drag this item you can “drop” it into the desired function such as: adding it to a favorite playlist, creating a brand new playlist using this song, or to access other functions that are less frequently used which would the prompt another page with more options to appear after the quick options wheel. We felt that the old playlist creation and editing was a bit boring and un­intuitive. We wanted to create a “fun” way to have people create playlists so that they might be more motivated to keep a personally curated playlist library, and hence, use the app more often and on a even deeper level.</p>
            <h3>Scenario 2: Creating a playlist using the charts feature</h3>
            <p class="lead">
            <em>Decision: What to include on the menu page to being navigation through to the charts section.</em></br> One of the more difficult decisions throughout this scenario was to decide what to include in our menu page. Spotify has a very condensed menu page where most of the clutter found in the other apps is all squeezed into a “Browse” button. We did not like this aspect of spotify since it meant that the user had to click on multiple pages to get where they wanted to go. Saavn app has all the options enumerated, which makes it look a bit complex. We figured that we would go for a mix of the two, and omit some of the features that were not immediately needed at the menu page level. Considering this we decided to include My Music, Radio, Moods &amp; Genres, New Releases, Charts and Trending, and People along with a distinct Settings button. Starting at the home page we also had to make a decision as to what links to have on the home page considering our scenario and what other possibilities the user might encounter. Overall we decided that a custom tailored home page was the best ­ the assumption was that the user would load up their profile with playlists and music, then the app would be able to generate a “taste” profile, which it would use to auto­populate the home page with content that is relevant to that user's music taste. Still, we wanted a sort of “anchor” for our users to be able to access lists, radio, moods &amp; genres and new releases off the bat when they started the app ­ we included a section right at the beginning of the home page dedicated to allowing the user to navigate to these 4 sections easily without having to go to the menu page.</p>
            <p class="lead">
            <em>Decision: Which navigation elements to keep with respect to editing playlists.</em></br>Since we have a unique way of creating and managing playlists, this was probably the easier of the difficult decisions we made. Since we do not require an option “select” tracks per se we decided to omit any widgets that were related to that sort of navigation. We only have the draggable section for tracks as the only way to manage your music. This ofcourse can be later changed to make the drag feature more dynamic; for example, if a user wanted to delete multiple songs from a playlist the drag feature might be a bit more tedious than having to enable an “edit” mode and tick all the songs you wanted removed, then only hitting the remove button once ­ we would have the users simply drag the song they didn’t want into a specified area that would be dedicated to removing tracks from playlists, and this would be unambiguous and consistent. In the end it was decided that this “tediousness” involved with dragging one song a time to the delete function was tolerable since it really isn’t doing much more than a single short press.
